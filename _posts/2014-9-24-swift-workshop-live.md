I am attending a Swift Workshop at CMU holds by Apple and it is awesome. I will put some
of my notes here live.

Auto Layout is Super Useful! Do not forget to update frame after set it.

Each view need one view controller.

UITableView, for more details, please check API.

- It contains header, content, and footer

- You can use Reuse queue to limit resource usage

- auto completion is not only useful, but also a good way to see if something is wrong

Navigation view:

Uses Segue to transite from one scene to another

drag and release helps a ton in Xcode, much easier than Java


Dinner time: Pizza and Sliders!!!
