title: Longest Streak on GitHub
category: code
---

Today is Sep 22, 2014. Six months later it is going to be Mar 22, 2015. My goal is to create a six month streak.

Currently I am exercising Cracking the Coding Interview everyday, and I might manage my Swift Hackthon project next week using GitHub as well.

Please help me and support me in finishing this goal. Thank you!
